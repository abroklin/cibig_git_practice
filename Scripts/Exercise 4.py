### Given the following list of odd numbers:
## starting from the odds list, builds a new evens list in which all the elements of odds are incremented by 1.

## stating the length of the list
len_odds = len(odds)
print(len_odds)
## stating the conditions for the even_list
index = 0
while index: len_odds:
    print((f"----- My index is {index}")))
print (f"my even list is : {len_odds[index]}\n")
index = index + 1
